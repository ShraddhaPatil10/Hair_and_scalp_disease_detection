# Hair and Scalp Disease Detection System

This project aims to detect and classify hair and scalp diseases such as **Alopecia**, **Psoriasis**, and **Folliculitis** using deep learning and image processing techniques. It includes a web-based interface built with Django, where users can upload an image of the scalp, and the system predicts the disease class in real-time.
